//assigning a type to a variable in TS looks like this:
// let myVar: type = value

//all types are lowercase
//by default if you dont assign type to a variable then it becomes the type:any which is dynamic like javascript and defeats its purpose

let myname:string = "Abdinasir" 
console.log(myname)
console.log(myname.toUpperCase)

let age: number = 23
console.log(age)

let gameOver: boolean = false;
console.log(gameOver)
